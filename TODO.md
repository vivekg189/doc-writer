# TODO for Making validate.py Executable

- [x] Add sample document texts for each type (rental_agreement, land_sale_deed, power_of_attorney) in the main block
- [x] Implement main block that calls validate_document for each sample and prints the results
- [x] Test the script execution to ensure output is produced
